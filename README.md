## Node addon for hardware VL6180 (x) sensor

##### This addon should work on any Linux platform, and has been thoroughly tested on BBB

### Install

Notably, this module is not dependant on any other modules except node-gyp for compilation.

```
npm install @agilatech/vl6180
```
OR
```
git clone https://github.com/Agilatech/vl6180.git
node-gyp configure build
```


### Usage
##### Load the module and create an instance
```
const addon = require('@agilatech/vl6180');

// create an instance on the /dev/i2c-1 I2C file at address 0x29
const vl6180 = new addon.Vl6180('/dev/i2c-1', 0x29);
```
If either the bus or address args are omitted, it defaults to /dev/i2c-1 and 0x29 respectively.


##### Get basic device info
```
const name = vl6180.deviceName();  // returns string with name of device
const type = vl6180.deviceType();  // returns string with type of device
const version = vl6180.deviceVersion(); // returns this software version
const active = vl6180.deviceActive(); // true if active, false if inactive
const numVals =  vl6180.deviceNumValues(); // returns the number of paramters sensed
```


#### Get parameter info and values
Sensed parameter values are at separate indicies.  The reasoning here is to support a generic sensor platform.
```
// range is at index 0
const paramName0 = vl6180.nameAtIndex(0);
const paramType0 = vl6180.typeAtIndex(0);
const paramVal0  = vl6180.valueAtIndexSync(0);

// lux is at index 1
const paramName1 = vl6180.nameAtIndex(1);
const paramType1 = vl6180.typeAtIndex(1);
const paramVal1  = vl6180.valueAtIndexSync(1);
```
If the device is not active, or if any parameter is disabled, the return value will be "none".


#### Asynchronous value collection is also available
```
vl6180.valueAtIndex(0, function(err, val) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err);
    }
    else {
        console.log(`Asynchronous call return: ${val}`);
    }
});
```


### Operation Notes
The VL6180 is a "Time of Flight" distance/proximity sensor.  It measures the time the IR emitted light takes to traverse the distance.  This unit measures from 0-100mm.  Note that beyond 100mm, the value returned is 255. The sensor also includes a lux light sensor.

In addition to the device info, this module returns name, type, and value at two indicies, 0 and 1.  Index 0 is for range, while index 1 is for lux.  Typical usage might look like this:

```
const range  = vl6180.valueAtIndexSync(0);
const lux = vl6180.valueAtIndexSync(1);
```
